# Alternative Approach: No-Code/Low-Code Agent with Google Cloud

It is possible to create a similar agent in Google's Agent Space without writing code, by using a combination of Google's no-code and low-code tools. Here is a conceptual step-by-step method:

### No-Code/Low-Code Method using Google's Agent Space

This method assumes you are using a Google Cloud project and its associated services.

**Step 1: Use a No-Code App Builder**

1.  **AppSheet:** Google's AppSheet is a no-code development platform that can be used to create applications that integrate with Google Workspace. You can create an AppSheet application that connects to your Google Drive and Gmail accounts.
2.  **Data Sources:** In your AppSheet application, you would define your Google Drive folder and your Gmail account as data sources.
3.  **Automations:** AppSheet allows you to create automations. You could create an automation that is triggered when a new email arrives in a specific Gmail label.

**Step 2: Integrate with a Pre-built AI Model**

1.  **Vertex AI:** Google's Vertex AI platform provides access to pre-trained AI models, including large language models (LLMs).
2.  **Cloud Functions:** You can use Google Cloud Functions to create a small piece of code that is triggered by your AppSheet automation. This Cloud Function would take the email content and the relevant documents from Google Drive and send them to the Vertex AI model.
3.  **Prompt Engineering:** In your Cloud Function, you would define a prompt for the LLM, similar to the one we created in the Python code. The prompt would instruct the model to act as a TAM assistant and generate a draft email reply.

**Step 3: Send the Draft Email**

1.  **Gmail API:** The Cloud Function would then use the Gmail API to send the draft email. The email could be sent to the TAM for review, or it could be saved as a draft in the TAM's Gmail account.

### Summary of the No-Code/Low-Code Workflow

```
New Email in Gmail (Trigger)
       |
       v
AppSheet Automation
       |
       v
Google Cloud Function
       |
       v
Vertex AI (LLM)
       |
       v
Google Cloud Function
       |
       v
Gmail API (Send Draft Email)
```

This approach allows you to create a powerful agent with minimal coding. You would primarily be using the graphical interfaces of AppSheet and Google Cloud to configure the workflow and the integrations.

While this method is not "no-code" in the strictest sense (you would need to write a small amount of code in the Cloud Function), it is a significant reduction in the amount of code required compared to building the agent from scratch in Python.

This approach also has the advantage of being fully managed by Google, so you don't have to worry about managing servers or infrastructure.

### Implementation Details

Here are more detailed implementation details for the AppSheet and Cloud Function components.

**AppSheet Implementation**

1.  **Create a new AppSheet App:**
    *   Go to [AppSheet](https://www.appsheet.com) and create a new application.
    *   Connect to your data source. You can start with a Google Sheet to manage the tasks for the agent.

2.  **Connect to Google Drive and Gmail:**
    *   In your AppSheet app, go to the "Data" section and add new data sources.
    *   Add your Google Drive folder as a data source.
    *   Add your Gmail account as a data source.

3.  **Create an Automation:**
    *   Go to the "Automation" section and create a new bot.
    *   **Configure the Event:**
        *   Create a new event and choose "Schedule" as the event type.
        *   Configure the schedule to run at a regular interval (e.g., every 15 minutes) to check for new emails.
    *   **Configure the Process:**
        *   Add a step to the process to read the list of unread emails from your Gmail data source.
        *   For each unread email, call a webhook.
    *   **Configure the "Call a webhook" Task:**
        *   Create a new task and choose "Call a webhook" as the task type.
        *   **URL:** This will be the trigger URL of your Cloud Function (see below).
        *   **HTTP Verb:** POST
        *   **Body:** Construct a JSON payload with the email details. For example:

            ```json
            {
              "email_subject": "[Subject]",
              "email_body": "[Body]",
              "customer_email": "[From]"
            }
            ```

**Cloud Function Implementation**

Here is a sample Python Cloud Function that you can use as a starting point. This function will be triggered by the AppSheet automation, process the email, and send a draft reply.

**`main.py`**

```python
import base64
import functions_framework
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import vertexai
from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel

# Initialize Vertex AI
vertexai.init(project="your-gcp-project-id", location="us-central1")

@functions_framework.http
def tam_assistant(request):
    """HTTP Cloud Function.
    Args:
        request (flask.Request): The request object.
    Returns:
        The response text, or any set of values that can be turned into a
        Response object using `make_response`.
    """
    request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)

    email_subject = request_json.get("email_subject")
    email_body = request_json.get("email_body")
    customer_email = request_json.get("customer_email")

    # --- 1. Search for relevant documents in Google Drive ---
    # This is a simplified example. You will need to implement your own logic
    # to find the relevant documents based on the email content.
    drive_service = build("drive", "v3", credentials=get_credentials())
    query = f"name contains ''{email_subject}''"
    results = (
        drive_service.files()
        .list(q=query, pageSize=1, fields="files(id, name)")
        .execute()
    )
    items = results.get("files", [])

    document_content = ""
    if items:
        file_id = items[0]["id"]
        request = drive_service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)
        document_content = request.execute().decode("utf-8")

    # --- 2. Generate the email draft using Vertex AI ---
    model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("text-bison@001")
    prompt = f"""
    As a Technical Account Manager (TAM) Assistant, your primary role is to assist TAMs by drafting email replies to customers.

    Here is the customer's email:
    Subject: {email_subject}
    Body: {email_body}

    Here is the content of a relevant document:
    {document_content}

    Please draft a professional email reply to the customer.
    """

    response = model.predict(prompt, temperature=0.2, max_output_tokens=1024)
    draft_reply = response.text

    # --- 3. Send the draft email using the Gmail API ---
    gmail_service = build("gmail", "v1", credentials=get_credentials())
    message = create_message("me", customer_email, f"Re: {email_subject}", draft_reply)
    send_message(gmail_service, "me", message)

    return "OK"

def get_credentials():
    # This is a simplified example. You will need to implement a more robust
    # way to manage credentials in a production environment.
    # You can use Secret Manager to store the credentials.
    creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file("token.json", SCOPES)
    return creds

def create_message(sender, to, subject, message_text):
    message = MIMEText(message_text)
    message["to"] = to
    message["from"] = sender
    message["subject"] = subject
    return {"raw": base64.urlsafe_b64encode(message.as_bytes()).decode()}

def send_message(service, user_id, message):
    try:
        message = (
            service.users().messages().send(userId=user_id, body=message).execute()
        )
        print(f"Message Id: {message['id']}")
        return message
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

```

**`requirements.txt`**

```
functions-framework
google-api-python-client
google-auth-httplib2
google-auth-oauthlib
vertexai
```

**Deployment and Configuration**

1.  **Deploy the Cloud Function:**
    *   Save the code as `main.py` and create a `requirements.txt` file.
    *   Deploy the function using the `gcloud` command-line tool:

        ```bash
        gcloud functions deploy tam-assistant \
            --runtime python311 \
            --trigger-http \
            --allow-unauthenticated
        ```

2.  **Get the Trigger URL:**
    *   After the deployment is complete, you will get a trigger URL. Copy this URL.

3.  **Configure AppSheet:**
    *   Go back to your AppSheet automation and paste the trigger URL in the "URL" field of the "Call a webhook" task.

This provides a more detailed, workable solution for a customer site, with the understanding that some parts, like the document search logic and credential management, will need to be adapted to the specific customer environment.

**Operationalizing the Agent**

Here are the steps to deploy and manage this agent in a production environment:

1.  **AppSheet Application:**
    *   **Deployment:** Once your AppSheet application is ready, you can deploy it to your users. You can share the application link with the TAMs who will be using it.
    *   **Security:** You can configure the security settings in AppSheet to restrict access to the application to specific users or groups.
    *   **Monitoring:** AppSheet provides a monitoring dashboard where you can track the usage of the application and the execution of the automations.

2.  **Cloud Function:**
    *   **Security:** In a production environment, you should not use unauthenticated Cloud Functions. Instead, you should use an authenticated Cloud Function and call it from AppSheet using a service account. This is a more secure approach.
    *   **Credential Management:** Instead of storing the `token.json` file in the same directory as the Cloud Function, you should use [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to securely store the credentials. Your Cloud Function can then retrieve the credentials from Secret Manager at runtime.
    *   **Error Handling:** You should add more robust error handling to your Cloud Function to handle cases where the APIs fail or the data is not in the expected format.
    *   **Logging and Monitoring:** You can use [Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) and [Google Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) to monitor the execution of your Cloud Function. You can set up alerts to be notified of any errors or performance issues.

3.  **Vertex AI:**
    *   **Model Management:** You can use the [Vertex AI Model Registry](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/introduction) to manage your LLM models. This allows you to version your models and roll back to a previous version if needed.
    *   **Monitoring:** You can use the [Vertex AI Model Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/model-monitoring/overview) to monitor the performance of your LLM model. You can track metrics like latency, error rate, and prediction accuracy.

By following these steps, you can create a robust and scalable agent that can be deployed and managed in a production environment.
