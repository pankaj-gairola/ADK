# Alternative Implementation using Vertex AI Agent Builder

This document outlines a detailed approach to building the "TAM Super-Agent" using Google Cloud's low-code/no-code platform, **Vertex AI Agent Builder**. This method shifts the development focus from writing Python code with the ADK to configuring a managed agent and its tools through a graphical interface, supplemented by serverless functions for custom logic.

## Core Concept

Instead of a central Python script orchestrating tool calls, we will use a **Vertex AI Agent** as the orchestrator. This agent will understand the TAM's natural language prompts, plan the necessary steps, and call upon a set of "tools" to execute the plan.

These tools will be implemented in three ways:
1.  **Data Store (for RAG):** A built-in Agent Builder feature for searching knowledge bases.
2.  **Vertex AI Connectors:** Pre-built, secure integrations to common enterprise systems (like CRMs).
3.  **Cloud Functions with OpenAPI:** Custom serverless functions that expose our specific business logic (like analyzing GCP data) as an API that the agent can call.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create the Vertex AI Agent

1.  Navigate to the **Vertex AI** section in the Google Cloud Console.
2.  Go to **Agent Builder** and click **"Create a new app"**.
3.  Choose the **"Agent"** app type. This is designed for multi-turn, tool-using applications.
4.  Give your agent a name (e.g., `tam-super-agent`) and select your region.

### Step 2: Configure the Agent's Goal and Instructions

In the Agent Builder UI, you'll find a section to define the agent's goal and instructions. This is the equivalent of the `TAM_SUPER_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS` variable in our Python code.

**Example Instructions:**

```text
You are a world-class AI assistant for a Google Cloud Technical Account Manager.
Your purpose is to be a force multiplier, automating data-gathering and initial drafting tasks.
Analyze the user's request, formulate a step-by-step plan, and use your available tools to execute it.
Prioritize human review; your final actions should be creating drafts or summaries, not sending communications directly.
```

### Step 3: Implement the Tools

This is the most critical part. We will recreate each of the Python mock tools using the most appropriate method in Google Cloud.

#### A. Knowledge Tool (RAG)

*   **Corresponds to:** `internal_knowledge_search_tool`
*   **Implementation:** Use a **Data Store**.
    1.  In Agent Builder, go to the **"Data"** section and create a new data store.
    2.  Choose the source: **Google Cloud Storage** or **Google Drive**.
    3.  Point it to the GCS bucket or Drive folder containing your knowledge base documents (post-mortems, product guides, etc.).
    4.  Agent Builder will automatically index the documents.
    5.  Associate this data store with your agent. The agent can now perform semantic searches over this content automatically when a user's question requires it.

#### B. CRM Tools

*   **Corresponds to:** `create_case_tool`, `get_customer_profile_tool`
*   **Implementation:** Use **Vertex AI Connectors**.
    1.  If your CRM is a common one (like Salesforce, Zendesk, or Jira), you can use a pre-built connector.
    2.  In the **"Tools"** section of your agent, click **"Create a tool"** and select **"Vertex AI Connectors"**.
    3.  Follow the wizard to configure the connection and authentication to your CRM instance.
    4.  The connector will expose the CRM's APIs (e.g., `createCase`, `getCustomer`) to the agent, which will learn how to use them from the API's own schema.

#### C. Custom GCP & Communication Tools

*   **Corresponds to:** `gcp_monitoring_tool`, `gcp_billing_tool`, `gmail_draft_tool`, `google_chat_tool`, `google_slides_tool`.
*   **Implementation:** Use **Cloud Functions** described by an **OpenAPI Specification**.

This is a two-part process:

**Part 1: Write the Cloud Functions**

For each tool, create a separate HTTP-triggered Cloud Function. These functions will contain the actual logic (which would eventually call the real Google Cloud APIs).

*   **`gcp-monitoring-function`:** Takes a `project_id`, calls the Cloud Monitoring API, and returns a JSON summary of the findings.
*   **`gcp-billing-function`:** Takes a `project_id`, calls the Cloud Billing API, and returns a JSON summary of cost-saving opportunities.
*   **`gmail-draft-function`:** Takes `recipient`, `subject`, and `body`, calls the Gmail API to create a draft, and returns the draft ID.
*   **`google-chat-function`:** Takes a `message`, calls the Chat webhook URL, and returns a success status.
*   **`google-slides-function`:** Takes `customer_name` and `data`, calls the Google Slides API to create and populate a presentation, and returns the presentation URL.

**Part 2: Create the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification**

Create a single `openapi.yaml` file that describes all your Cloud Functions. This file is how the agent learns what your custom tools are, what parameters they need, and what they do.

**Example `openapi.yaml` snippet:**

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: "TAM Custom Tools API"
  version: "1.0.0"
paths:
  /analyze-gcp-monitoring:
    post:
      summary: "Analyzes Google Cloud Monitoring data for a project to find issues."
      operationId: "gcp_monitoring_tool"
      # 'x-google-backend' points to your Cloud Function's trigger URL
      x-google-backend:
        address: "https://<region>-<project>.cloudfunctions.net/gcp-monitoring-function"
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                customer_project_id:
                  type: string
                  description: "The Google Cloud project ID of the customer."
      responses:
        '200':
          description: "Analysis successful."
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
  /draft-gmail:
    post:
      summary: "Creates a draft email in Gmail."
      operationId: "gmail_draft_tool"
      x-google-backend:
        address: "https://<region>-<project>.cloudfunctions.net/gmail-draft-function"
      # ... (define requestBody and responses similarly) ...
```

**Part 3: Add the Tool to the Agent**

1.  In the **"Tools"** section of your agent, click **"Create a tool"**.
2.  Select **"API & Schema"** (or OpenAPI).
3.  Upload your `openapi.yaml` file.
4.  Agent Builder will parse the file and make all the defined functions available to the agent as callable tools.

### Step 4: Test and Iterate

Use the **"Test"** panel in the Agent Builder UI to interact with your agent. Provide it with the same prompts used in the Python project.

**Example Prompt:**

> "Run a proactive health and cost check for Customer X and draft an email to the internal engineering team with the findings."

The agent will show its thought process, including which tools it's calling (`gcp_monitoring_tool`, `gcp_billing_tool`, `gmail_draft_tool`) and the parameters it's using. You can then debug and refine your tool descriptions or agent instructions as needed.
